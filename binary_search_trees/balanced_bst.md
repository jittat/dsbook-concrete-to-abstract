## Balanced Binary Search trees

As previously discussed, a binary tree which is highly imbalanced may require
$$O(n)$$ time to perform an operation, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes.  This
section provides an example of binary search tree with additional constraints
that ensure that every node has depth $$O(\log n)$$.

### Height constraints

### Rotation

### Double Rotation

### Worst case depth
