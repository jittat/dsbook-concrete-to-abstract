# Introduction

This is an attempt to write a data structure textbook whose materials are motivated by real-world examples.  Another goal for this book is to also provide rigorous approaches to data structure analysis.  This book aims to be real-work focused, and at the same time, shows the reader how to mathematically analyze and prove properties of data structures.
