## Performance: introduction

Different programs using different approaches sometimes solves the same problem
with different efficiency.  In our previous examples, we actually implements
different solutions and compare their running times.  If we want to find out
which method is the fastest to solve a particular problem, this may be the best
way.  However, there are cases where we can tell, even before implementing the
solutions, which solution should run faster, when the input is large.  The
ability to analyze (even roughly) the efficiency before having to spend time
implementing the solutions is extremely useful.  In this section, we will
discuss the techniques to analyze algorithm running times.
