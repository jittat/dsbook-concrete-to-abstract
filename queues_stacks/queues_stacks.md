# Queues and stacks

Queues and stacks are widely used data structures.  You might be familiar with
queues, but internally, stacks are also used everywhere.  Every time you make a
function call in your code, stack operations are executed.

The reason discuss both data structures in the same chapter is that they can be
easily implemented with linked lists.
